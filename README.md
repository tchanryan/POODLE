You are Dr. Barktholomeow, the most fearsome hacker in the universe!

With your hacking skills, you could achieve virtually anything - rick roll the entire world, bankrupt Elon Musk, shut down TikTok... but your cause is much more nefarious (and noble). You aim to hack every computer on Earth to replace all the text on all of its files with dog and cat puns. By hacking one computer network at a time, soon, no-paw-dy will be able to h-yelp talking like t-hiss! It will be purr-fect! Meow-eow-eow-eow!

You call the process of hacking a computer "poodling". To poodle an entire network of computers, you will first poodle an initial computer which you have access to by installing a worm on it (which you affectionately call a "pug"). This computer will then forward the pug to other computers that it is directly connected to so that they can be poodled as well.

To spread your influence as quickly as possible, your plan has been to poodle computer networks owned by the world's most popular websites. You have already poodled networks owned by Poodle (formerly Google), YouChewb (formerly YouTube) and Faceboop (formerly Facebook). Now you have set your sights on another popular website: Wikipetia!

Wikipetia's network consists of computers and connections between pairs of computers. Each computer has a security level between 1 and 10, and takes a certain amount of time to poodle. The security level of a computer determines what other computers it is allowed to communicate with: a computer with security level 
X
 can only send to computers with security level 
X
+
1
 or smaller. Each connection is bidirectional and has a transmission time associated with it, which is the amount of time it would take to send something (such as your pug) from the computer at one end of the connection, to the computer at the other end.
